## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Joshua Lee, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Bucknell University. I previously interned as a Data Scientist at MITRE, where I applied artificial intelligence to enhance and modernize legacy systems. In addition, I spent two summers as a Research Assistant, developing and implementing machine learning algorithms on swipe-based biometric data with a focus on ensuring fairness and reducing bias.
